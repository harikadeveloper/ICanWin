'Cause, ah-ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a rolling stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha ching like money
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go
